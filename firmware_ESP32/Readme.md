# MODE 1 - ESP32

Remember, there are two ways to use PaperBack - either with only the first board and an ESP32 mounted, or with the VGA board attached. In this directory are various firmwares to use the ESP32 in different ways.

Again: If you choose to drive PaperBack with the ESP32, DO NOT ATTACH THE SECOND BOARD. They _are_ modular, but I didn't add any electronics to switch between the two. If the second board is added, the ESP32 is connected to the exact same signal lines and you will short.
