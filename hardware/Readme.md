# Hardware Directory

Here you'll find the files you will need to reproduce Paperback.  There are two boards:

* *PaperBack_Display* The Display breakout board.  Can take an ESP32 Development Kit and run the display without the Video converter board.
* *PaperBack_Converter* The VGA conversion board.  Takes VGA, captures a frame, puts it in memory, then outputs to the ePaper screen.

## Editing the Files

All files are from KiCad, although Gerbers are a universal format.  I've also included the PDF schematics as well if you'd like to spin a new PCB from scratch.
